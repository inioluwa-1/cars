            First Look: Every Formula 1 Car Racing in 2024

        <p class="fs-5 text-justify">It’s barely been three months since Max Verstappen won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but the 2024 Formula 1 season is already upon us. The new campaign gets off to a bizarre start thanks to the relative lack of drama at the top of the grid. Red Bull Racing was so dominant last season—the team won 20 grands prix—that it’s hard to imagine anyone, even Mercedes or Ferrari, catching up with them this season. But the best part of sports is that things rarely go as planned, even in Formula 1. We’re 15 years removed from Jenson Button claiming one of the most unexpected titles in the championship’s history. Regardless, as Netflix’s Drive to Survive has shown us, F1 is about more than just who wins. With that in mind, here’s a rundown of all the cars that will be part of the grid in 2024.</p> <br>
        <h2>Red Bull Racing RB20</h2>

        <p class="fs-5 text-justify">
            Red Bull Racing would appear to be sitting pretty after completing one of the most dominant season in the competition’s history (it won 20 of last year’s 22 grand prix). That didn’t stop the team from trying to iron out a few kinks with its 2024 car, RB 20. So far the early signs are good, with the car performing excellently in pre-season testing. It also helps that Red Bull still has three-time-defending driver’s champ Max Verstappen in one its cars (teammate Sergio Perez is no slouch, despite some of last season’s struggles). The biggest question as the season starts is if the misconduct allegations surrounding team principal Christian Horner prove to be a distraction—which it almost certainly will, thanks to Max’s father—even after team has cleared him of any wrongdoing.

            <p class="fs-5 text-justify">After two years of spent dealing with serious design issues, Mercedes-AMG Petronas will hope they finally have things right this season. The new race car, W15, is a new concept and has performed well enough in testing. The team may have finished second last year, but we imagine principal Toto Wolff would love to get Lewis Hamilton his record-breaking eighth driver’s championship in his final season with the team before switching over to Ferrari. Mercedes’s other driver, George Russell, also wouldn’t mind a strong season that shows his team they’re still in good hands.</p>
